##  Building Neural Nets using PyTorch
In this repo, I will explore what PyTorch is all about.

I will also code  4 different use cases and see how well PyTorch performs.

### Contents 
1. What is PyTorch?
2. Use Case 1: Handwritten Digits Classification (Numerical Data, MLP)
3. Use Case 2: Objects Image Classification (Image Data, CNN)
4. Use Case 3: Sentiment Text Classification (Text Data, RNN)
5. Use Case 4: Image Style Transfer (Transfer Learning)
